# MyGoApp Deployment Pipeline

This README explains how to set up and run the deployment pipeline for MyGoApp using GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub repository containing application code and this workflow file.
2. Docker Hub account for storing Here's a README.md file explaining how to set up and run the pipeline and its prerequisites:

# MyGoApp Deployment Pipeline

This README explains how to set up and run the CI/CD pipeline for deploying MyGoApp to a K3s cluster.

## Prerequisites

1. GitHub repository with application code
2. DockerHub account
3. K3s clusters for staging and production environments
4. kubectl and Helm installed on your local machine (for testing)

## Setup

1. Fork or clone this repository to your GitHub account.

2. Set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

   - `DOCKER_HUB_USER_NAME`: Your DockerHub username
   - `DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your DockerHub access token
   - `STAGING_KUBECONFIG`: Base64 encoded kubeconfig for the staging cluster
   - `PROD_KUBECONFIG`: Base64 encoded kubeconfig for the production cluster
   - `STAGE_NODE_IP`: IP address of a node in your staging cluster
   - `PROD_NODE_IP`: IP address of a node in your production cluster

3. Ensure your repository has the following structure:

## Running the Pipeline

The pipeline is triggered automatically on pushes to the `main` and `staging` branches.

1. For staging deployments:
- Push your changes to the `staging` branch
- The pipeline will build, push, and deploy to the staging environment

2. For production deployments:
- Push your changes to the `main` branch
- The pipeline will build and push the images
- A manual approval step will be required
- After approval, the pipeline will deploy to the production environment

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

- Monitor the pipeline progress in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository
- Check the logs of each step for any errors or issues
- Ensure your K3s clusters are accessible and properly configured
- Verify that all required secrets are set correctly in your GitHub repository

### Note

This pipeline assumes you're using K3s clusters. If you're using a different Kubernetes distribution, you may need to adjust the deployment steps accordingly.
